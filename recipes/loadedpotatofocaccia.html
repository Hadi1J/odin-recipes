    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      There are few things in life I love more than a fully loaded potato with
      sour cream, scallions, lots of cheese, and crispy bacon. Add that on top
      of another fluffy carb, and I’m in heaven. This recipe was inspired by the
      famous Sally’s Apizza, one of the most beloved makers of New Haven-style
      pizza. They have a Potato & Rosemary pie that I love. My take is a little
      more kid-friendly, thanks to the Cheddar cheese and bacon. The key is to
      cut the potatoes thinly and evenly so they have time to cook through in
      the oven. I like to cook this until the potatoes start to crisp a little
      on top, offering the best of both worlds: creamy and crunchy potatoes!

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 cups lukewarm water</li>
      <li>1 (0.25 ounce) packet active-dry yeast, such as Red Star®</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon sugar</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon kosher salt</li>
      <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>
        step 1
        <p>
          For the focaccia: Pour water into a large bowl and sprinkle yeast and
          sugar on top. Mix briefly with a dough whisk or wooden spoon, then let
          sit until the yeast has bloomed, about 10 minutes. When ready, the top
          of the bowl should look like a foamy beer.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        step 2
        <p>
          Stir in olive oil and salt. Add all-purpose flour and bread flour and
          stir with the dough whisk or a wooden spoon until no dry streaks of
          flour remain.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        step 3
        <p>
          Cover the bowl and allow to rise for 45 minutes. After 45 minutes,
          uncover the bowl and wet your hands slightly. Starting at the top of
          the bowl, use your wet hands to pull the top edge of the dough up and
          over the dough ball. Continue this process until you work your way all
          around the dough. This is known as a stretch and fold. It helps to
          develop gluten and replaces traditional kneading. Cover the bowl again
          and let sit in a warm spot.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        step 4
        <p>
          After 30 minutes, repeat the stretch and fold process. Cover the bowl
          and perform two more sets of stretches and folds 30 minutes apart.
          After the 4th stretch and fold, cover the bowl and let sit for 30
          minutes.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        step 5
        <p>
          At this point, the dough should have doubled in volume and should be
          smooth to the touch. The dough is now ready to be used, or can be
          chilled overnight to use the next day.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        step 6
        <p>
          For the toppings: Lightly oil a 9x13-inch metal cake pan. Set the
          focaccia base in the pan, using your fingers to gently stretch it into
          all four corners. Cover the focaccia and let rise for about 1 hour.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        step 6
        <p>Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).</p>
