    <p>
      Gelato made with cream, milk, egg yolks, and sugar. This basic recipe is
      from my Italian mother-in-law and is perfect to use as a base for your
      favorite flavors. Try adding vanilla, shaved chocolate, or your favorite
      fruits. They're all delicious!

          Mix milk and cream in a medium saucepan. Warm until foam forms around
          the edges. Remove from heat.

          Beat egg yolks and sugar until frothy in a large bowl. Gradually pour
          warm milk into egg yolks and sugar, whisking constantly. Return
          mixture to saucepan; cook over medium heat, stirring with a wooden
          spoon until the mixture gels slightly and coats the back of the spoon.
          If small egg lumps begin to show, remove from heat immediately.

          Pour the mixture into an ice cream maker, and freeze according to the
          manufacturer's instructions. Transfer to a sealed container, and
          freeze until firm, at least 2 hours.
